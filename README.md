## WeatherSwag vs WeatherExpress
Upon reflection, I realized it was a poor choice to go with technologies that I am unfamiliar with for this challenge.

I spent no more than 6 hours working on WeatherSwag with two new technologies to me, Swagger and Hapi.

To show the difference between working with new technologies and those that I'm well versed in, I chose to create WeatherExpress using Express, Webpack, Babel, and React. 6 hours was spent working on WeatherExpress.
